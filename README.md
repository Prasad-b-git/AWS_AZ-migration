## Prerequisites
- Azure subscription with appropriate permissions
- AWS account with access to source instances
- Network connectivity between AWS and Azure environments
- Required ports open for communication between environments
- Windows Server 2022 for Appliance Server
- Windows Server 2016 for Replication Server

## Infrastructure Requirements

### Source Environment (AWS)
- AWS instances with documented specifications
- Operating systems details
- Storage configurations
- Network settings

### Target Environment (Azure)
- **Appliance Server:**
  - Operating System: Windows Server 2022
  - CPU: 8 vCPU
  - RAM: 16 GB
  - Storage: 80 GB
  - Role: Hosts migration tools and services

- **Replication Server:**
  - Operating System: Windows Server 2016
  - CPU: 8 vCPU
  - RAM: 32 GB
  - Storage: 300 GB
  - Role: Manages data replication to Azure

### Required Azure Resources
- Resource Group
- Azure Migrate Project
- Azure Site Recovery components

## Migration Process

### 1. Pre-migration Phase
1. Create Resource Group in Azure
2. Set up Azure Migrate Project
3. Generate discovery key

### 2. Setup Phase
1. Appliance Server Configuration
   - Install Azure Migration tools
   - Configure network settings
   - Connect to Azure Migrate project
   - Add credentials for source servers
   - Initiate discovery process
   - Create assessment

2. Replication Server Setup
   - Install Microsoft Azure Site Recovery Unified Setup
   - Configure MySQL database
   - Register with Azure Site Recovery vault
   - Configure network settings

3. Source Server Configuration
   - Install Azure Site Recovery agent
   - Configure mobility service
   - Ensure proper network connectivity (port 443/HTTPS)
   - Verify agent installation

### 3. Replication and Migration
1. Configure replication settings
2. Select appropriate VM sizes for target machines
3. Choose disk types for migrated servers
4. Start replication process
5. Monitor replication status
6. Execute migration when replication is complete

## Best Practices

### Performance Optimization
- Allocate sufficient bandwidth for replication
- Monitor network latency
- Manage resource utilization during migration
- Schedule migrations during off-peak hours

### Security Measures
- Configure appropriate firewall rules
- Set up security groups for migrated VMs
- Implement access controls
- Enable encryption for data in transit and at rest
- Configure regular backups

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. Replication Delays
   - Verify bandwidth availability
   - Check network connectivity
   - Monitor resource utilization

2. Appliance Issues
   - Validate configuration settings
   - Check service status
   - Analyze log files

3. Agent Installation Problems
   - Ensure correct version compatibility
   - Verify connectivity to replication server
   - Check port configurations

## Documentation
- Complete process documentation with screenshots
- Configuration details for all components
- Migration reports and assessment results
- Performance metrics and issue logs
